THIS SPACE HERE

## Concept
This space hopes to hold some kind of framework for a "bring it back to bacon" type visualization. Kevin Bacon will be the test case, the end result will be that users can differentiate degrees of social separation (film roles) between actors/actresses.

## Status


## TODO
database platform: shrug. will have to script to parse out imdb tsv files at any rate.
database schema: should pay mind, and account for processing/db lookups for the ever popular execution time.
back-end: node.js/express
front-end: html5/d3.js
